<h1 style="color:rgb(60, 255, 0);">What is corona virus/covid19</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
    
    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the <disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. <br>
    <p>Corona virus cases in world is around 86 million</p>

<h1 style="color:rgb(60, 255, 0);">How Corona started?</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px"> The World Health Organization (WHO) has released its plan to investigate the origins of the COVID pandemic. The search will start in Wuhan — the Chinese city where the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first identified — and expand across China and beyond. Tracing the virus’s path is important for preventing future viral spillovers, but scientists say the WHO team faces a daunting task.

    Most researchers think the virus originated in bats, but how it jumped to people is unknown. Other coronaviruses have passed from an intermediate animal host; for example, the virus that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–04 probably came to people from raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) or civets.
    
    “Finding an animal with a SARS-CoV-2 infection is like looking for a needle in the world’s largest haystack. They may never find a ‘smoking bat’” or other animal, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York City. “It will be key for the investigators to establish a collaborative relationship with scientists and government officials in China.”
    
    Nailing down the origins of a virus can take years, if it can be done at all, and the investigation will also have to navigate the highly sensitive political situation between China and the United States. US President Donald Trump has been “calling it a China virus and the Chinese government is trying to do everything to prove that it is not a China virus”, says Linfa Wang, a virologist at Duke–National University of Singapore Medical School. The political blame game has meant that crucial details about research under way in China have not been made public, says Wang, who was part of the WHO mission that looked for the origin of SARS in China in 2003.       </p>

<h1 style="color:rgb(60, 255, 0);">First case of corona virus in India</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px">The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia,[7] and has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States with more than 10.3 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and more than 149 thousand deaths as of January 02, 2021.[8] The per day cases peaked mid-September in India with over 90,000 cases reported per day and have since come down to below 40,000 in December.[9][10]


    In July 2020, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting claimed the country's case fatality rate was among the lowest in the world at 2.41% and "steadily declining".[11] By mid-May 2020, six cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country – Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[12] As of 10 September 2020, Lakshadweep is the only region which has not reported a case.[13] On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.[14] Infection rates started to drop significantly in September, and the number of daily new cases and active cases started to decline rapidly.[15] A Government panel on COVID-19 announced in October that the pandemic had peaked in India, and may come under control by February 2021.[16] India has over 30 anti-COVID vaccines in various stages of development and the first of these is expected to be introduced in early 2021.</p>

<h1>Symptoms of corona virus/covid 19 </h1>
<p style="font-size:25px">People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19: <br>

  1.  Fever or chills <br>
  2.  Cough <br>
  3.  Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing <br>
  4.  Fatigue <br>
  5.  Muscle or body aches <br>
  6.  Headache <br>
  7. New loss of taste or smell <br>
  8.  Sore throat <br>
  9.  Congestion or runny nose <br>
  10.  Nausea or vomiting <br>
  11.  Diarrhea <br></p>

<h1 style="color:rgb(60, 255, 0);">Phases of Corona virus/covid 19</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px">Phase 1: No animal viruses that are circulating have been reported to cause any infections in human beings.  A new type of virus is identified and is examined in animals or humans anywhere in the world that are thought to have consequences on human health.<br>

    Phase 2: An animal virus in wild or domestic animals are reported to cause infection in human beings. Rising cases are identified with an increased possibility for human to human transmission.<br>
    
    Phase 3: An animal or person to animal virus can produce sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in population. Incomplete human-to-human transmission can occur in specific circumstances. Cases of the virus are confirmed with both proficient and continual human to human transmission.<br>
    
    Phase 4: Persistent person-to-person spread and community outbreaks can occur. The new virus can infect susceptible population. Public health officials should take measures such as encouraging social distancing, closing schools and colleges and if available offer antiviral medications or vaccines.<br>
    
    Phase 5: Person-to-person transmission in at least two countries within a single World Health Organization region.<br>
    
    Phase 6: The actual pandemic phase is when the human-to-human spread is seen in at least one country outside of the two initially infected WHO region. Even after the pandemic subsides, public health officials continue to monitor and observe the virus and prepare for another wave of disease.<br> </p>

<h1 style="color:rgb(60, 255, 0);">Precaution of coronavirus/covid19.</h1>
<p style="font-size:25px">Avoid going outside especially childrens and old person.<br></p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Use mask if you are going outside.<br></p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Maintain social distancing (i.e 2meters or 6feet).<br> </p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Download government app such as Arogya setu.<br></p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Use sanitizer and take bath whenever you come home from outside.<br></p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Sanitize your objects like bags,watches if waterproof.<br></p>

  
    <h1 style="color:rgb(60, 255, 0);">Vaccine of Corona/Covid19</h1>
    <p style="font-size:25px">The world is in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic. As WHO and partners work together on the response -- tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing vital medical supplies to those in need--- they are racing to develop and deploy safe and effective vaccines. 

        Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural defences --- the immune system--- to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing germs later, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness.
        
        There are currently more than 50 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in trials. WHO is working in collaboration with scientists, business, and global health organizations through the ACT Accelerator to speed up the pandemic response. When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries. People most at risk will be prioritized. While we work towards rolling out a safe and effective vaccine fairly, we must continue the essential public health actions to suppress transmission and reduce mortality.</p></br>

<h1 style="color:rgb(60, 255, 0);">Question and Answer about the vaccine of corona virus</h1>

<p style="font-size:25px">Q uestion - Is the vaccine for Covid 19 ready? </p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Answer - On Sunday, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin for restricted emergency use.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">Question - Who approved Covid 19 vaccine?</p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Answer - NEW DELHI : The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday approved the Oxford coronavirus vaccine and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, making it India's first vaccines against the pandemic.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">Question - What are some side effects of Pfizer's Covid vaccine?</p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Answer -Typical side effects may include swelling or pain at the point of injection, tiredness, fever or headache, as well as muscular or joint pain. The incidence of fever has so far been found to be higher after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.</p>

<p style="font-size:25px">Question - Are you immune to COVID-19 if you get it once?</p>
<p style="font-size:25px">Answer - Research is still ongoing into how strong that protection is and how long it lasts. WHO is also looking into whether the strength and length of immune response depends on the type of infection a person has: without symptoms (‘asymptomatic’), mild or severe. Even people without symptoms seem to develop an immune response.</p>
